<p id="elderlydescription">The average age of a golfer is 54, which falls in this category of what we are going to call, "elderly".  This page explains why there is a high enough number of golfers that fall in this category.  In 2019, the number of golfers that were age 65 and older increased to 5.3 million.  More specifically, golfers who were 65 years of age and older played an average of 36 rounds in 2019.  That number is three times the average number of rounds played of golfers between the ages of 18 and 34.  The reason behind this is, not only because golf is a sport that one can play their whole life no matter their age, but moreso because these older individuals are retired and do not have work-related obligations to meet.</p>
<p id="elderlydescription2">In fact, there is a professional golf tour for golfers who are age fifty and older called the PGA Champions Tour.  On this tour, professional golfers who meet the minimum age requirements are the only golfers allowed to participate in the tournaments.</p>
