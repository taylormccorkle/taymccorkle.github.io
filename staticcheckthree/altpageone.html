<p id="description">Kids can start learning how to play golf as early as age two, but most kids don't start playing golf until age five or six.  In most cases, the youth that plays golf plays the game for fun and entertainment.  The sport is mentally complex which is more difficult for young kids to grasp than teens or young adults.  Friendhsips are formed when young children start playing golf.  Many kids, as they get older, still have a relationship with their golfing buddies from their childhood.  That's the beauty of this sport! </p>
